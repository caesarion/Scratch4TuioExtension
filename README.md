# Scratch4TuioExtension
This is a scratch extension for tuio. The extension enables Scratch to receive TUIO messages and react to TUIO events . This way, the Scratch-programmer is able to not only create its own Tangible User Interface, but also to create interfaces using Kinect or Mobile Phones and interfaces that can track objects.
Users of Scratch4TUIO can use the new blocks to react to TUIO-events such as a moving cursor or a moving object. Furthermore, they can access information about the objects such as the symbolID, sessionID, movement speed, movement acceleration, position, angle, turning speed, and turning acceleration.

For more information about the TUIO protocol see http://www.tuio.org/
